Objective:
Design a web-based modular dashboard system that empowers users to create and manage personalized workspaces using a flexible plugin architecture and a customizable multi-zone grid layout. The system must prioritize usability, extensibility, and aesthetic appeal, with streamlined deployment options for both a Debian operating system and a containerized environment.

Core Features
1. Dynamic Multi-Zone Grid Layout
A 3x3 grid structure with predefined zones:
Top (Left/Center/Right)
Middle (Left/Center/Right)
Bottom (Left/Center/Right)
Multi-Zone Support:
Widgets can span across multiple zones, both horizontally and vertically, to accommodate larger components like charts, tables, or complex visualizations.
Example configurations:
Single-zone widget in Middle Center.
Horizontal span across Top Left, Top Center, and Top Right.
Vertical span across Middle Left, Bottom Left.
Ensure clear visual indicators for grid boundaries when configuring multi-zone widgets.
Interactive Grid Customization:
Users can merge or split zones dynamically within the grid to create custom layouts.
Provide a "zone management" tool for intuitive merging (e.g., drag to select multiple zones).
2. Background Grid Zone
A dedicated background grid zone independent of the main 3x3 layout:
Designed for non-interactive elements such as logos, global announcements, background images, or dashboard headers.
Supports layering and styling (e.g., transparency, background animations).
3. Overlay Zone
A dynamic overlay zone for widgets or content that appears only when triggered by user interaction or system events.
Use Cases:
Notifications, alerts, or modal dialogs.
Context-sensitive widgets, such as detailed analytics, expanded charts, or additional information.
Action prompts (e.g., "Are you sure?" confirmation dialogs).
Configuration:
Widgets in the overlay zone can be dynamically shown or hidden based on triggers (e.g., button clicks, alerts, or timed events).
Supports multiple layers, enabling stacking of content (e.g., a modal dialog over a notification).
Styling:
Semi-transparent darkened background to emphasize the overlay widgets.
Smooth transitions for showing and hiding the overlay zone.
4. Plugin Management Interface
Core Functionality:
Add, remove, or update plugins through a user-friendly interface.
Enable or disable plugins on the fly without affecting the dashboard's state.
Advanced Features:
Categorization of plugins (e.g., visualization tools, analytics, utilities).
Plugin preview and testing environment before full deployment.
Version control for installed plugins with rollback options.
5. Widget Placement and Configuration
Widget Placement:
Manual assignment of widgets to specific zones, overlay zone, or across multiple zones via a layout configuration panel.
Provide a visual drag-and-drop tool to adjust widget spans across multiple zones.
Configuration Options:
Customizable widget parameters (e.g., data source, display settings).
Save and restore widget configurations for individual users or sessions.
6. Centralized Settings Hub
Dashboard-Wide Settings:
Theme selection (dark/light modes, custom themes).
Layout presets for rapid dashboard configuration.
Advanced Preferences:
Language localization and timezone settings.
User-specific preferences saved across sessions.
Deployment Requirements
1. Deployment Script (Debian)
The system must include a deployment script to automate installation and configuration on a Debian-based operating system.
Script Features:
Dependency Management:
Install all required libraries and runtimes (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker, web server).
Web Server Setup:
Configure Nginx or Apache for hosting the dashboard.
Database Configuration:
Install and configure the necessary database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
Environment Setup:
Include configuration for production and development modes with .env files.
Security:
Set up SSL/TLS for secure connections.
Troubleshooting:
Provide checks for common issues (e.g., missing dependencies, port conflicts).
2. Containerization
The system must provide a containerized deployment option using Docker or similar technologies for a consistent, portable environment.
Features of the Containerized Solution:
Multi-Service Architecture:
Separate containers for the application, database, and web server (e.g., Nginx).
Docker Compose:
Provide a docker-compose.yml file for easy setup of all services.
Environment Configuration:
Include configuration files for customizing container behavior (e.g., volumes, ports, network settings).
Scalability:
Support container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes for scaling.
Security:
Implement best practices for container security, such as minimal base images and isolation.
Documentation Requirements
1. README File
The project must include a complete and comprehensive README file covering:
Overview:
Project description, core features, and use cases.
Setup Instructions:
Step-by-step guide to set up and deploy the system using both the Debian deployment script and containerized solution.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting:
FAQ for resolving setup and runtime issues.
Development Guide:
Instructions for contributing or extending the system with custom plugins.
License Information:
Include the chosen license details (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
UI/Style Guidelines

Focus on usability with subtle visual guides for grid zones.
Widget Styling

Rounded corners, translucent backgrounds, and seamless interactive elements.
Overlay Zone Styling

Semi-transparent darkened background to emphasize overlay content.
Smooth animations for entry and exit.
